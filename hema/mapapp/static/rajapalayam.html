    Rajapalayam  is a town in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is the largest municipality in the Virudhunagar district[citation needed]. Rajapalayam is located on the Madurai to Quilon National Highway at a distance of 562 km south of the state capital Chennai. The economy is primarily industrial with several mills for spinning and weaving. The town is known for its mango and the Rajapalayam breed of dogs.
    The principal industry was initially agriculture. In 1936, Thiru P. A. C. Ramasamy Raja started the first cotton spinning mill, called Rajapalayam Mills Ltd. Later, more textile mills were started. Today, Rajapalayam is a major hub of the textile industry, famous for bandages, woven fabric, nightwear, and other products.
     The neighboring town of Chatrapatti (Virudhunagar Dist.) is a large player in producing surgical cotton gauze, and nearby Dhalavaipuram and Muhavoor manufacture women's nightwear.
